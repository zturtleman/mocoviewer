MocoViewer is a MD3 model file viewer developed for Mac OS X.

With mobile devices breathing new life into old code, finding working tools can be hard.  After working with the Quake 3 engine this tool was developed at NGMOCO:) to view MD3 model files on the Mac OS X platform.

Please post suggestions for features.
